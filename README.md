*ðŸš– Ride Booking Analysis Dashboard â€“ Power BI*

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard built using ride-booking data sourced from Kaggle.
The goal was to analyze revenue, demand-supply gap, cancellations, and customer/driver experience using advanced data visualization techniques.

During development, I also leveraged Power BI Copilot AI to auto-generate DAX measures and accelerate dashboard building.

*ðŸ“Š Key Insights*

ðŸ”¹ Revenue Analysis

Total Revenue: â‚¹52M

Average Revenue per Ride: â‚¹508.30

Vehicle types like Auto (â‚¹12.9M) and Go Mini (â‚¹10.3M) contribute maximum revenue.

Revenue trend shows monthly fluctuations with clear seasonality.


ðŸ”¹ Demand & Supply

62% rides completed, while 25% cancellations were observed.

7% No Driver Found, highlighting supply shortages.

AI-driven analysis shows demand often exceeds supply in certain months.


ðŸ”¹ Operational Performance

Driver Experience Score: 4.23 (Target: 4.50 â†’ -5.92%)

Customer Experience Score: 4.40 (Target: 4.50 â†’ -2.26%)

These KPIs help monitor service quality against business goals.


ðŸ”¹ Booking Status Breakdown

Completed: 93K rides (62%)

Cancelled by Driver: 10.5K (7%)

Cancelled by Customer: 9K (6%)

No Driver Found: 10.5K (7%)

Incomplete: 27K (18%)

ðŸ›  Tools & Techniques Used

Dataset Source: Kaggle (Ride-booking dataset).

Power BI â€“ for dashboard creation & visual storytelling.

Power BI Copilot AI â€“ assisted in generating DAX formulas like:

Completion % = DIVIDE([Completed Rides], [Total Bookings])

Cancellation % = DIVIDE([Cancelled Rides], [Total Bookings])

Avg. Revenue per Ride = DIVIDE([Total Revenue], [Completed Rides])


Data Cleaning & Transformation â€“ Power Query.

Visualizations â€“ Pie Charts, KPI Cards, Line Charts, and Trend Analysis.
